                        While looking at the data provided by Bridge To Calculus,
                        we discovered there are multiple schools enrolled in BtC.
                        We thought it would be great if there was a measure that could
                        compare each school. The above graph illustrates the average attendance
                        per year for each school, and it allows users to select specific schools
                        they want to see.  There are some schools enrolled for all 5 years, and some
                        are enrolled for just a year. The graph shows that the schools with students
                        enrolled in Bridge to Calculus for all 5 years and with the highest average
                        attendance rate are Boston Community Leadership Academy (orange line) and The
                        English High School (pink line).
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">Recommendation Distributions Among Schools</h2>
                    <img src="dataReport/images/barchart.png" width=100%>
                    <p>
                        Continuing the comparison between schools, we concluded showing the distribution of
                        recommendations at each school can illustrate what type of education each school should focus
                        on. The Y-axis on the graph is the number of recommendations, and the number of recommendations
                        with the length of the full column equal to the number of students enrolled in BtC. This graph
                        can be used to analyze students` general math level. For example, the left-most column,
                        The John D. O`Bryant School of Mathematics, shows that the majority of students were
                        recommended to take AP Calculus AB. The fourth column from the left, Boston Community
                        Leadership Academy, shows there is no student who is recommended Pre-Calculus. By analyzing
                        these statistics, schools and BtC can educate their students more efficiently.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">Total Recommendation</h2>
                    <img src="dataReport/images/bubbles.png" width="100%">
                    <p>
                        This graph shows the distribution of recommendations, with the size of each recommendation being
                        proportional to the number of recommendations. This graph is useful when determining what
                        subjects students mostly need help with. According to the graph, AP Calculus AB carries the
                        biggest portion of recommendations, followed by Pre-Calculus. With this graph in mind, Bridge To
                        Calculus should prepare more teachers for AP Calculus AB and Pre-Calculus than Regular Calculus
                        or AP Calculus BC.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">School Distribution</h2>
                    <img src="dataReport/images/tree.png" width="100%">
                    <p>
                        If Bridge To Calculus were to expand locally, figuring out the schools where students actively
                        engage the most would be beneficial. To accomplish that, we made a visualization that shows the
                        top 10 schools with the highest average attendance rate. We added a condition to schools to have
                        at least 5 students because there were some schools with only one or two students. The
                        visualization can be utilized in marketing Bridge To Calculus in the targeted school regions. In
                        addition, it can be easily reversed, show which schools are particularly vulnerable and target
                        the schools with low attendance rate with different approaches.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">Students Enrollment Over Years</h2>
                    <img src="dataReport/images/lined.png" width="100%">
                    <p>
                        The best way to prove the effectiveness of Bridge To Calculus is by comparing the grades of
                        students` math scores before and after their enrollment in Bridge To Calculus. However, we do
                        not have that data, so we concluded that the best alternative is to show the number of students
                        enrolled per year. This graph directly shows the size of the group, and a constant upper-right
                        trend will indicate the group`s growth rate. The data shows a decline in the number of students
                        in 2019, followed by slight growth in 2021. (There was no Bridge to Calculus program in 2020 due
                        to the pandemic)
