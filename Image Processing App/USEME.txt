open a GUI which has a specified help button to explain the directions.

You can run it with the commands -text which will give you text controller that you can
interact with live. 
You can use the argument -file followed with the path of a script to run the
program using a script.

Below is how to use the GUI program

It is capable of loading an image, operating numerous transformations on it, and saving the image
after being transformed.

To load an image, click on the load button above and pick an image to load into the program
(.jpg, .ppm, and .png are supported). Once the image is loaded, it will show up on the left in
the drag down menu. You may load multiple images at once.

Chose the image you would like to transform, give it a new name in the "Transformation Name" text
field, then pick the type of transformation you would like to do from the transformations
drop down, by default the initial name is the name of the file without extension from where
the image was initially loaded to. If there are extra parameters, you must fill them, then press go
and the transformation will be applied. If to save it under existing name,
it will override that one.

If you would like to save the image, click the save button above, type a name for the image,
pick a destination and then click save.
